KPCSplitPanes
==============

A set of classes, among which a subclass of NSSplitView, that splits when you're intented to make panes.
Horizontal and vertical panes can be combined.

Installation
------------

Using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage): add `github "onekiloparsec/KPCSplitPanes"` to your `Cartfile` and then run `carthage update`.

Using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/): `pod 'KPCSplitPanes'`


Usage
-----

KPCSplitPanes is a lot a work in progress right now. A demo is here to show how to use it. Basically, install
a `NSSplitView` in your xib/storyboard, declare it as a `PressureSplitView`, build a dedicated delegate, and assign
it to the split view.

The choice between horizontal and vertical split can be toggled by pressing `Alt` key.
 
**It is mandatory for the container view to not use AutoLayout.**
 
What is currently not perfect/working
* The automatic adjustment isn't working in all cases
* The position of the divider isn't always right
* The window can be resized whatever the split view constraints
* I'm sure there is something else...
